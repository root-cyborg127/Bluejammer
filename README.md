## Installing

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/jieggiI/BLUETOOTH-DOS-ATTACK-SCRIPT.git
$ cd BLUETOOTH-DOS-ATTACK-SCRIPT/
$ python3 Bluetooth-DOS-Attack.py
```
### Note
<p>The script works only with Linux systems.</p>
<p>You must have "l2ping" util on your linux machine (it installed as default on Kali Linux).</p>
<p>YOU MUST SCAN AND ATTACK BEFORE SOMEONE CONNECT TO THE TARGET!!!</p>

## It tested on
Kali Linux as attacker, and Xiaomi Portable Bluetooth Speaker as target

## Using
<p>First of all, you must scan network for Bluetooth devises. For example, you can use "hcitool".</p>

```
$ sudo apt update
$ apt install hcitool
$ sudo service bluetooth start
$ hcitool scan
```
<p>Output will be like:</p>

```
A1:B2:C3:D6:E7      Xiaomi portable speaker
B1:C2:D3:E4:F5      iPhone(Toivo)
C1:D2:E3:F4:G5      Some Bluetooth device
```
<p>Then copy target addres (for example "A1:B2:C3:D6:E7") and paste it in "Target addr".</p>

## Manual

1. "Target addr" - addres of your target (Check info above).
2. "Packages size" - size of the packages, that will be sent to the target. 600 is optimal.
3. "Threads count" - number of threads, that will send packages to the target at the same time. I used 500 threads, and that was enough. Check the table below, to find optimal value.

|  Packages size | Threads count| Ping, ms  | Distance, meters | Time waited, sec  | Device |
|:--------------:|:-----: |:------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------:|:------:|

## What happens to the target device

<p>I can't say about all devices, but device I tested just turned off.</p>
